AnyEvent-Redis2

AnyEvent::Redis2 is an event-driven (asynchronous) client for the Redis
key-value (NoSQL) database server.  Both standard query and subscriber modes
are available.

WHY THIS MODULE?

AnyEvent::Redis2 began as a clean-room implementation of a Redis module for
AnyEvent.  Instead of abandoning it, I decided to upload it.  

The substantive differences from AnyEvent::Redis are minimal:

- Cleaner, simpler API
- Better documentation (IMHO)
- Explicit separation of subscriber functionality (into
  AnyEvent::Redis2::Subscriber) 
- Simpler, faster protocol parser (note the large number of parser bugs
  previously reported in AnyEvent::Redis)

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
