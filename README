AnyEvent-Redis2

AnyEvent::Redis2 is an event-driven (asynchronous) client for the Redis
key-value (NoSQL) database server.  Both standard query and subscriber modes
are available.

WHY THIS MODULE?

AnyEvent::Redis2 began as a from-scratch implementation of a Redis module for
AnyEvent.  (When I began writing it, I didn't know such a module already
existed.)  Instead of abandoning it when I realized my oversight, I decided to
contribute it. 

The substantive differences from AnyEvent::Redis are:

- Better documentation
- on_connect() callback 
- Simpler, faster protocol parser (about 30% faster sending large numbers of
  queries, about 10% faster receiving bulk responses)
- Easier-to-read code

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
